# Coding challenge - Bigger is greater
Lexicographical order is often known as alphabetical order when dealing with strings. A string is greater than another string if it comes later in a lexicographically sorted list.

Given a word, create a new word by swapping some or all of its characters. This new word must meet two criteria:

It must be greater than the original word
It must be the smallest word that meets the first condition
Example
w=abcd
The next largest word is abdc.

Complete the function biggerIsGreater below to create and return the new string meeting the criteria. If it is not possible, return no answer.
